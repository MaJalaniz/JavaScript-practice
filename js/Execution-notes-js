Execution Context - Stores variables and which our code is evaluated and executed

Global Execution Context - not inside a function
                           Associated with the global object
                           In a browser / window object

GEC is associated with the EC ^

GEC is for code that is not in a function

the function is also in the GEC

the first(); this new context is placed on the GEC as a EC



ECO - Variable Object
             -Argument object is created/has all arguments passed into function
Hoisting     -scanned for function declarations/ for each function a property is created in the VO point to function (DEFINED)
Hoisting     -Scanned for variable declarations/ each variable a property is created in VO /set to (UNDEFINED)

Hoisting - functions/variables available before execution starts

     Scope Chain
     "This" Variable

1. Creation Phase
    -Creation of the variable object
    -Creation of the Scope chain
    -Determine the value of "this" variable

2. Execution Phase
    - The code of the function that generated the current EC is ran line by line
